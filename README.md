# Terminology

Defines the terms we are using. Doesn't mean they can't be used differently.
This is just the way we use them. 

## How to propose additions or changes:

* In Github, clone this repository.
* In your cloned copy, make the changes that you would like to see. If you have more than
  one proposed change, we suggest you propose them in smaller chunks; that makes it more
  likely that they will be accepted.
* Create a Pull Request. (There are many excellent descriptions on the web for how to do
  this.)

## How to discuss pull requests:

* On Github, annotate the proposed changes with your comments.
* Anybody involved with Me2B is encouraged to comment.

## How your pull requests will be processed:

We don't know yet! But we'll find out as soon as there are some :-)
